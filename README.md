## Notes

The challenges I have encountered while building the app was understanding how view controller works. In addition, as I was working on building the app, I was interested in different object library in iOS app. I was confused which object library to use. I search most of my question through google however, it would be great if there was a site that provide examples of each object library. I am still learning to become a better iOS developer.
